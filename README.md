# Bikesharing

## Overview
### Purpose
To create an analytical story in Tableau to reflect the data in graphs.  The data we are using is a bike sharing program called "citibike". 

## Results 
### Python
  - Used Pandas to update a column in data frame for time conversion where it has hours and minutes and gender to show "Male, Female, and Unknown".  

### Worksheets and Story
  - Checkout by Users
    - Graph shows the times of user counts.
    - This graph states that the 2nd hour mark has more users than the previous hour. The            growth steadily increases after the 1st hour mark.

  - Checkout by Gender
    - Graph states the gender of user counts with the same time as above image. 
    - This chart explains the gender of the user.  The "male" gender line shifts the overall         count on the previous slide. 

  - Trips by Weekday
    - Data below shows the user count for each hour of the day and day of the week. The most         count of users are on Thursday's between 5-7 PM.  The time of day with the most users         are consistent at 5-7 PM on the weekdays.

  - Trips by Gender (weekday/hour)
    - The breakdown of genders are below with time of day and days of the week. "Male" makes         up the largest count of users of those times.

  - Trips by Weekday
    - This chart has the breakdown of the user type: Customer and Subscriber with gender             shown.  "Male" is the highest count for subscriber which does correlate to the other           slides.  The "Unknown" is the highest for customer usertype.  Potentially due to               tourist not wanting to either provide the data or in a rush to use the bike.  The             highest customer count usage is on Saturdays which is logicial for a tourist or visitor. 
  
  - Repair Time
    - The hours of usage is shown below.    
    
  - Start Station
    - Graph shows the start stations by gender and the size of the count. 
  
  - Stop Station
    - Graph has the stop stations by gender and the size of the count. 

## Results
### Proposed Repair Time in Story
  - The best times for repairs are from 1 AM to 5 AM.

### Proposed Review
  - We have to look into the reasoning why more males or willing to use this app. Maybe if we improve the bikes or stop/start locations in a way females would be willing to use this app as much as males do.
